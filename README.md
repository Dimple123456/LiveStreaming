# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

I developed a Live Streaming Website using ZEGOCLOUD, where users can create and join live video streaming sessions in real time. The project was built to explore cloud-based communication technology and implement interactive live streaming features with an attractive and responsive interface. The website initially worked using the ZEGOCLOUD free trial, and although the current trial has ended, it can function properly again with a new login and API credentials. This project showcases my ability to integrate third-party APIs and experiment with modern web technologies.
